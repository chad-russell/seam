# TODO

- [x] local variables
- [x] if/else
- [x] functions as values
- [x] pointers
  - [x] address-of
  - [x] permit taking address of immediate value -- do the trick where we put it on the stack and then save it so it has memory
  - [x] deref
  - [x] function pointers
- [x] function parameters
- [x] structs
  - [x] declaration
  - [x] struct literals (with own slot)
  - [x] dot syntax
  - [x] address of field
- [x] syntax overhaul -- more c/rust/go/jai like
- [x] basic enum support
  - [x] set enum tag during enum literal construction
  - [x] set enum tag when assigning to field through a dot
  - [ ] support `.tag` pseudo-property
  - [ ] check enum tag when accessing through a field
- [x] let binding type inference
- [ ] generics
  - [x] for functions
  - [x] for structs
  - [ ] for enums
  - [x] copy functions/structs when instantiating so we can do multiple
  - [ ] baking
  - [x] check conflicts during unification
- [x] (mutually) recursive structs / functions
- [ ] compile-time functions -> macros
- [ ] return type inference (`fn foo() { return 3; }` should infer return type i64)
- [ ] auto-declaration of poly variables -> inline anonymous functions -> lambdas
- [ ] more math
- [ ] void return type
- [ ] single function call as a statement (i.e. `foo();` should be a valid function statement)
- [ ] structs as function parameters / return values
  - [ ] follow C ABI, at least for extern functions
- [ ] arrays
- [ ] while
- [ ] f32/f64
