# TODO

- [ ] redo macros the rust way, just accept and return a token stream
- [ ] debugging
- [ ] basic enum support
  - [x] set enum tag during enum literal construction
  - [x] set enum tag when assigning to field through a dot
  - [ ] support `.tag` pseudo-property
  - [ ] check enum tag when accessing through a field
- [ ] generics
  - [x] for functions
  - [x] for structs
  - [ ] for enums
  - [x] copy functions/structs when instantiating so we can do multiple
  - [ ] baking
  - [x] non-type (constant value) params
  - [x] check conflicts during unification
- [ ] first-class types
  - [ ] in generics we should be able to do compile-time logic on the `T` type that doesn't make it into the final executable
    - [ ] should be able to pass into a function that runs at compile-time only for example
  - [ ] same with anything that comes as the result of `typeof`
- [ ] defer
- [ ] auto-declaration of poly variables -> inline anonymous functions -> lambdas
- [ ] math (binary operations)
- [ ] single function call as a statement (i.e. `foo();` should be a valid function statement)
- [ ] if
  - [x] basic if/else statement functionality
  - [ ] as value expression
  - [ ] `else if`
- [ ] short-circuit logical `and` and `or`
- [ ] while
- [ ] for (with macros?)
- [ ] f32/f64
- [ ] structs as function parameters / return values
  - [ ] structs as compile-time parameters / return values
  - [ ] follow C ABI, at least for extern functions
